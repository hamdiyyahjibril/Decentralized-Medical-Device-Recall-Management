# Decentralized Medical Device Recall Management

## Overview

This blockchain-based platform transforms medical device recall management by creating a secure, efficient system for tracking implanted devices and notifying affected patients. The solution addresses critical gaps in the current recall process, where device manufacturers and healthcare providers often struggle to identify and contact all affected individuals in a timely manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures patient safety while maintaining privacy and regulatory compliance.

The system operates through four integrated smart contracts:

1. **Device Registration Contract**: Records details of implanted medical devices
2. **Patient Tracking Contract**: Securely links devices to recipient patients
3. **Alert Distribution Contract**: Manages notification of affected individuals
4. **Replacement Coordination Contract**: Tracks recall compliance and device updates

## Key Benefits

- **Rapid Response**: Dramatically reduces time to notify affected patients
- **Enhanced Patient Safety**: Ensures critical recalls reach all affected individuals
- **Privacy Protection**: Maintains patient confidentiality through encryption
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meets FDA, HIPAA, and international requirements
- **Complete Traceability**: Full audit trail for all implanted devices
- **Coordinated Resolution**: Streamlines replacement and follow-up procedures
